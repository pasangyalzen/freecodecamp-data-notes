    "Pandas is a Python tool that helps you work with data easily ‚Äî like how Excel works with tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It lets you:\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tRead data from files (like CSV or Excel)\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tLook at it in a table format\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tClean it if it‚Äôs messy\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tSort, filter, and analyze it\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tSave the clean data again\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is used a lot in data analysis, data science, and machine learning because most real-world data comes in table form ‚Äî with rows and columns ‚Äî and Pandas makes working with that kind of data super simple and powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas gives you 2 main tools:\n",
    "\t1.\tSeries ‚Üí a single column (like a list with labels)\n",
    "\t2.\tDataFrame ‚Üí a full table (like an Excel sheet)\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt works on top of NumPy, meaning it uses NumPy under the hood to do fast calculations but adds labels (column names and row numbers) so it‚Äôs easier to understand and work with.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs made for structured data (tables), which is the kind of data you usually get in the real world: CSVs, spreadsheets, databases, survey results, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Pandas is Important\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs the starting point for any data science or machine learning project\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt helps you explore and clean data before you can build charts or train models\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs much easier to use than raw Python or NumPy when working with tabular data\n",

    "\n",
    "üßÆ NumPy (Numerical Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a Python library that focuses on numerical operations and high-performance computations using arrays.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt works with n-dimensional arrays (like lists of numbers, grids, or even 3D arrays).\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs mainly used for mathematical operations, linear algebra, matrix multiplications, and scientific calculations.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs extremely fast because it uses optimized C code underneath.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tData in NumPy doesn‚Äôt have column or row labels ‚Äî just index positions (like array[0][1]).\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs perfect when you need to work with large sets of numbers or mathematical modeling, such as building machine learning algorithms from scratch.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tHowever, for real-world data like customer information or CSV files, NumPy alone is not very intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚∏ª\n",
    "\n",
    "üêº Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a library built on top of NumPy that makes working with structured/tabular data much easier. Behind the scenes numpy is the one that is working as a engine for most of the cases. Pandas can be considered as a dashboard for now.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt introduces two main data structures: Series (1D labeled array) and DataFrame (2D labeled table).\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tWith Pandas, you can easily read data from files like CSVs, Excel sheets, and databases.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt allows you to filter, sort, group, and clean data using human-friendly row and column labels.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs designed to make real-world data handling simple and efficient ‚Äî especially when data is messy or unstructured.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tWhile it‚Äôs not as fast at pure number crunching as NumPy, it makes data analysis workflows far more convenient.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIn most data science projects, Pandas is used first to clean and explore the data, and then NumPy may be used underneath for the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is built using NumPy (for data handling and speed), Cython (for performance), and Python (for structure), and it wraps them into a simple, powerful toolkit for working with structured data."

    "The use of the log is to reduce the skewness of the data and bringing it closer to the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness refers to the asymmetry in a dataset‚Äôs distribution. When data is right-skewed (positively skewed), it has a long tail on the right, meaning a few large values pull the average higher‚Äîcommon in things like income data. In left-skewed (negatively skewed) data, the tail is on the left, and a few low values pull the average lower. A dataset with no skew is symmetrical, meaning its values are evenly spread around the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution, also known as a bell curve or Gaussian distribution, is a special type of symmetrical data distribution where most values cluster around the mean, and fewer values appear as you move away from it. In this distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same. Many natural phenomena, like height, weight, and standardized test scores, tend to follow this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are widely used in statistics, machine learning, economics, and healthcare. Many algorithms and statistical tests assume that the data is normally distributed. When data is highly skewed, transformations like logarithms are used to reduce skewness and bring the data closer to a normal distribution, which helps improve model accuracy and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "If 80% of your sales are high and only 20% are low, and those few low sales are much lower than the rest, your data becomes left-skewed (not right-skewed). Why? Because the long tail of the data is on the left side ‚Äî those very low sales pull the distribution in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if most of your sales are low, but a few sales are extremely high, it becomes right-skewed, with a long tail on the right (the high sales stretch the curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution would mean that most sales are around the average, and both low and high sales are relatively balanced ‚Äî say, a 60/40 split, or even more balanced like 50/50, with symmetry around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about Standard Deviation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation does not measure skewness, but instead measures spread ‚Äî how far your data points are from the mean. In a normal distribution, standard deviation tells you things like:\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\t~68% of values lie within ¬±1 standard deviation from the mean\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\t~95% within ¬±2\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\t~99.7% within ¬±3\n",
    "\n",
    "In skewed data, standard deviation can be misleading, because the mean itself is pulled by outliers. That‚Äôs why we often transform skewed data (e.g., with a log transform) to bring it closer to normal, making standard deviation and other statistical tools more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tail is the key to skewness:\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIf the tail is on the right side (towards the higher values), the data is right-skewed (positively skewed).\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tThis means most data points are low or moderate, but there are some very high values pulling the tail out to the right.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tIf the tail is on the left side (towards the lower values), the data is left-skewed (negatively skewed).\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢\tThis means most data points are high or moderate, but there are some very low values pulling the tail out to the left.\n",
