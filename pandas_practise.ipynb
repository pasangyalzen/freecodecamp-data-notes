    "Pandas is a Python tool that helps you work with data easily — like how Excel works with tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It lets you:\n",
    "\t•\tRead data from files (like CSV or Excel)\n",
    "\t•\tLook at it in a table format\n",
    "\t•\tClean it if it’s messy\n",
    "\t•\tSort, filter, and analyze it\n",
    "\t•\tSave the clean data again\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is used a lot in data analysis, data science, and machine learning because most real-world data comes in table form — with rows and columns — and Pandas makes working with that kind of data super simple and powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas gives you 2 main tools:\n",
    "\t1.\tSeries → a single column (like a list with labels)\n",
    "\t2.\tDataFrame → a full table (like an Excel sheet)\n",
    "\t•\tIt works on top of NumPy, meaning it uses NumPy under the hood to do fast calculations but adds labels (column names and row numbers) so it’s easier to understand and work with.\n",
    "\t•\tIt’s made for structured data (tables), which is the kind of data you usually get in the real world: CSVs, spreadsheets, databases, survey results, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Pandas is Important\n",
    "\t•\tIt’s the starting point for any data science or machine learning project\n",
    "\t•\tIt helps you explore and clean data before you can build charts or train models\n",
    "\t•\tIt’s much easier to use than raw Python or NumPy when working with tabular data\n",

    "NumPy is a Python library that focuses on numerical operations and high-performance computations using arrays.\n",
    "\t•\tIt works with n-dimensional arrays (like lists of numbers, grids, or even 3D arrays).\n",
    "\t•\tIt’s mainly used for mathematical operations, linear algebra, matrix multiplications, and scientific calculations.\n",
    "\t•\tIt’s extremely fast because it uses optimized C code underneath.\n",
    "\t•\tData in NumPy doesn’t have column or row labels — just index positions (like array[0][1]).\n",
    "\t•\tIt’s perfect when you need to work with large sets of numbers or mathematical modeling, such as building machine learning algorithms from scratch.\n",
    "\t•\tHowever, for real-world data like customer information or CSV files, NumPy alone is not very intuitive.\n",

    "🐼 Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a library built on top of NumPy that makes working with structured/tabular data much easier. Behind the scenes numpy is the one that is working as a engine for most of the cases. Pandas can be considered as a dashboard for now.\n",
    "\t•\tIt introduces two main data structures: Series (1D labeled array) and DataFrame (2D labeled table).\n",
    "\t•\tWith Pandas, you can easily read data from files like CSVs, Excel sheets, and databases.\n",
    "\t•\tIt allows you to filter, sort, group, and clean data using human-friendly row and column labels.\n",
    "\t•\tIt’s designed to make real-world data handling simple and efficient — especially when data is messy or unstructured.\n",
    "\t•\tWhile it’s not as fast at pure number crunching as NumPy, it makes data analysis workflows far more convenient.\n",
    "\t•\tIn most data science projects, Pandas is used first to clean and explore the data, and then NumPy may be used underneath for the calculations.\n",
    "\n",

    "The use of the log is to reduce the skewness of the data and bringing it closer to the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness refers to the asymmetry in a dataset’s distribution. When data is right-skewed (positively skewed), it has a long tail on the right, meaning a few large values pull the average higher—common in things like income data. In left-skewed (negatively skewed) data, the tail is on the left, and a few low values pull the average lower. A dataset with no skew is symmetrical, meaning its values are evenly spread around the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution, also known as a bell curve or Gaussian distribution, is a special type of symmetrical data distribution where most values cluster around the mean, and fewer values appear as you move away from it. In this distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same. Many natural phenomena, like height, weight, and standardized test scores, tend to follow this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are widely used in statistics, machine learning, economics, and healthcare. Many algorithms and statistical tests assume that the data is normally distributed. When data is highly skewed, transformations like logarithms are used to reduce skewness and bring the data closer to a normal distribution, which helps improve model accuracy and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "If 80% of your sales are high and only 20% are low, and those few low sales are much lower than the rest, your data becomes left-skewed (not right-skewed). Why? Because the long tail of the data is on the left side — those very low sales pull the distribution in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if most of your sales are low, but a few sales are extremely high, it becomes right-skewed, with a long tail on the right (the high sales stretch the curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution would mean that most sales are around the average, and both low and high sales are relatively balanced — say, a 60/40 split, or even more balanced like 50/50, with symmetry around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about Standard Deviation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation does not measure skewness, but instead measures spread — how far your data points are from the mean. In a normal distribution, standard deviation tells you things like:\n",
    "\t•\t~68% of values lie within ±1 standard deviation from the mean\n",
    "\t•\t~95% within ±2\n",
    "\t•\t~99.7% within ±3\n",
    "\n",
    "In skewed data, standard deviation can be misleading, because the mean itself is pulled by outliers. That’s why we often transform skewed data (e.g., with a log transform) to bring it closer to normal, making standard deviation and other statistical tools more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tail is the key to skewness:\n",
    "\t•\tIf the tail is on the right side (towards the higher values), the data is right-skewed (positively skewed).\n",
    "\t•\tThis means most data points are low or moderate, but there are some very high values pulling the tail out to the right.\n",
    "\t•\tIf the tail is on the left side (towards the lower values), the data is left-skewed (negatively skewed).\n",
    "\t•\tThis means most data points are high or moderate, but there are some very low values pulling the tail out to the left.\n",

    "A DataFrame in pandas is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure that resembles a table or spreadsheet, where data is organized in rows and columns. Each column in a DataFrame can hold different types of data (e.g., integers, floats, strings), and each column is essentially a Series, which is a one-dimensional labeled array. The key difference is that a Series represents a single column of data with an associated index, while a DataFrame is a collection of multiple Series sharing a common index, allowing for more complex data manipulation and analysis. In simpler terms, a Series is like a single column, and a DataFrame is like a full table made up of multiple such columns."

    "The one of the thing we should understand is that like in other slicing where the start: end , step were the params that a method would take. But the case is different when we use the loc and iloc instead of taking the step it is actually taking the column and filtering only the given column. loc and iloc are the method only used by the pandas. So now we can conclude that since series is a 1D array and doesnot have a column. We donot pass anything in place of a step. We can similarly pass multiple columns name to extract multiple datas as well."

    "When your DataFrame uses numbers as index values, such as 0, 1, 2, and so on, it can become unclear whether you’re referring to the index label (like index 0) or the row’s position (the first row). This can lead to confusion or errors in your code. To avoid this ambiguity, it’s best to use .iloc[] when you want to select rows by their position (for example, the first, second, or third row), and .loc[] when you want to select rows by their index label (for example, the row that has an index of 0, even if it’s not the first row). This makes your code clearer and helps prevent mistakes."
